About the “practical solutions”, you may refer to ‘SMART’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).
  Specific (simple, sensible, significant)
  Measurable (quantitative, meaningful, motivating)
  Achievable (agreed, attainable)
  Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based)
  Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive)



I’d record the main AIs in today 25G mentor/mentee review meeting.
Please send the requests to all mentor/mentee and ask them to send the report to Manager and Upper Managers by Jul 28.
My intention: mentees can achieve max objectives with min efforts by practical solutions.

-	Insert Commitment Pages in Material.
-	Have deeper analysis and discussion with mentor to have practical solution, get review of GrL and report results to Manager/Senior Manager via email by Jul 28 (You can select the most important skills and report practical solutions).
